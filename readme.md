# Role-Based Access Control Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a **role-based access control system** built using React.js and Node.js. The aim was to explore a tech stack outside my current expertise (Laravel and Next.js) to broaden my skills and also frontend ui components was copied from my previous project.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)
- **Runtime**: Bun

---

## Features Implemented
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users are assigned roles with specific permissions to access resources.
- **Authentication**: Secure login/logout functionality using JWT.
- **Data Management**: User and product data stored in a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM.
- **Performance**: Experimented with Bun for faster runtime performance.

---

## Future Enhancements
Due to time constraints, the following features are planned for future implementation:
- Edit/Delete functionality for users and products.
- Docker support for containerization.
- Deployment to AWS for scalability and reliability.

---

## Learning Outcome
Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with React.js and Node.js, and I learned how to:
- Implement role-based access control without relying on frameworks.
- Integrate TypeScript for a more robust codebase.
- Use Bun to enhance runtime performance.

I also used AI tools like LLMs to debug issues and deepen my understanding of React.js and Node.js, ensuring I understood the solutions instead of merely applying them.

---

## Challenges
Balancing this project with my part-time Laravel role and academic commitments was challenging but rewarding. Managing time effectively helped me complete the core features by the deadline.

---

## Next Steps
I plan to work on the remaining features in a separate branch and explore advanced deployment options like AWS with Docker. Stay tuned for updates!
